# herohonda-JOINT-VENTURE
Both the companies went into a joint venture with an agreement that it was only for domestic production and consumption. As Hero Honda Motor Company was one of the largest manufacturers of two-wheelers, it wanted to expand itself by exporting to other countries. Subsequently, the agreement was modified and allowed the exports to a few countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Columbia. Now, Honda had its subsidiary companies in many countries. The issues arose when Hero Honda came up with exporting its motorbikes to other countries in 2008, where Honda already had its subsidiaries. Honda made a opinion that Hero Honda will have to compete on its own in the other countries because Honda could not influence its subsidiaries to import their JV’s products.
